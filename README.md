Utility to capture a RAW image from a machine vision camera and save it as a DNG.
In the future, I plan to expand this into a GUI with many more options, real time previews,
image processing (HDR, MSNR, white balance, tone mapping) with JPEG/JXL export, and the
ability to also record video in raw or AV1 encoded formats. The goal is to get nicely
processed aesthetically pleasing "better than cell phone" images and "cinema grade" video
from machine vision cameras.
